	<description>Caves is one of the biomes we have never covered or even considered covering before, but here we are! With this mod, you can tame powerful cave bears, collect colorful blind salamanders, run away from insectoid hulks, bond with incredibly agile and dangerous wyrms, get poisoned by cave crawlers or discover giant spider nests!

This mod supports the Arachnophobia setting which removes legs from the spiders, making them look much more friendly!

This mod has been commissioned by Aquiles and created and balanced by Vanilla Expanded team.

Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Endangered biome expansion. It adds 11 new animals that will spawn as part of a new event. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.
